The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.child .grandchild {
  color: green;
}

/* HTML Structure */
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child">
    <span class="grandchild"></span>
  </div>
</div>
```

The `!important` declaration on `.child` overrides the specificity of `.parent`, resulting in the `child` element having red text.  However, the `grandchild` inherits the `color: blue` from its parent. This unexpected inheritance happens because the `!important` rule only directly affects the `.child` element, and does not explicitly override inheritance for its descendants.
