To fix the issue, explicitly target the grandchild element and set its color with a higher specificity or another !important declaration.

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.child .grandchild {
  color: green !important; /* Solution: Add !important to grandchild */
}
```

This approach removes the unexpected inheritance and ensures that the `grandchild` element receives the intended green color.
